<p>Rsync version 3.0.0 is finally here!  This is a feature release that
also includes quite a few bug fixes.

<p>The 3.0.0 version number is such a large bump up from 2.6.9 due to the
addition of an
incremental recursion scan (which helps a lot with large transfers) and the
official arrival of several other new features, including ACL support, extended
attribute support, filename character-set conversion, etc. 

<p>See the <a href="https://download.samba.org/pub/rsync/src/rsync-3.0.0-NEWS">release NEWS</a>

<h3>Rsync version 2.6.9 released</h3>

primarily addresses an exclude problem that affected the --relative option,

which contains a <a href="security.html#s2_6_6" class=security>security fix</a>
to handle a null-pointer bug that turned up in rsync's version of zlib
1.1.4 (this is not the recent zlib 1.2.2 security fix, which did not
affect rsync) and to squash a few other minor bugs.  To deal with the
zlib issue, rsync has been upgraded to include zlib 1.2.3.

<h3>Rsync 2.6.5 released</h3>
<i class=date>June 1st, 2005</i>

for the details of what changed since 2.6.4.

<p><hr>
<h3>Rsync 2.6.4 released</h3>

<h3>Rsync 2.6.3 released</h3>

and quite a few bug fixes, including a <a href="security.html#s2_6_3" class=security>security
fix</a> for a patch-sanitizing bug in the daemon code.

<p>See the <a href="https://download.samba.org/pub/rsync/src/rsync-2.6.3-NEWS">release NEWS</a> for the
details of what changed since 2.6.2.

<p><hr>
<h3>Rsync 2.6.2 released</h3>
<i class=date>April 30th, 2004</i>

<p>Rsync version 2.6.2 has been released.  It is a bugfix release that mainly
fixes <b>a bug with the --relative option (-R) in 2.6.1</b>
that could cause files to be transferred incorrectly.  This only affected a
source right at the root of the filesystem, such as "/" or "/*" (if you
first "cd /" and then copy from ".", it would not tickle the bug).

<p>See the <a href="https://download.samba.org/pub/rsync/src/rsync-2.6.2-NEWS">release NEWS</a> for the
details of what else was fixed.

<p><hr>
<h3>Rsync 2.6.1 released</h3>
<i class=date>April 26th, 2004</i>

<p>Rsync version 2.6.1 has been released.  It is primarily a performance
release that requires less memory to run, makes fewer write calls to the socket
(lowering the system CPU time), does less string copying (lowering the user CPU
time), and also reduces the amount of data that is transmitted over the wire.
There have also been quite a few bug fixes, including a
<a href="security.html#s2_6_1" class=security>security fix</a> for a daemon problem when chroot
is not enabled.  See the
<a href="https://download.samba.org/pub/rsync/src/rsync-2.6.1-NEWS">release NEWS</a> for the full
details.

<p><hr>
<h3>One Cygwin hang-problem resolved</h3>

<p>The problem with rsync hanging at the end of the transfer on
<a href="http://www.cygwin.com/">Cygwin</a> had been previously traced to a
signal-handling bug in their compatibility DLL.  This bug appears to now be
fixed in DLL version 1.5.7-1, and Cygwin users are reporting that upgrading the
DLL removes the hang-at-end-of-transfer problem for their existing rsync executable.
(Note that this doesn't solve a hang that some folks see in the middle of a
transfer -- using daemon mode instead of ssh can work around that one.)

<p><hr>
<h3>Rsync 2.6.0 released</h3>
<i class=date>January 1st, 2004</i>

<P> Two important things to note in the new release:

<ol>

<li>The default remote shell is now "ssh" unless you tell configure you want to
make something else the default.

<li>Some bug fixes in the include/exclude code, while making things work
properly, have resulted in some user-visible changes for certain wildcard
strings.  Read the BUG FIXES section in the
<a href="https://download.samba.org/pub/rsync/src/rsync-2.6.0-NEWS">NEWS file</a> to see if
any of these changes apply to you.
(Most people should be unaffected.)

</ol>

<p>One other item of note is that the oft-requested option "--files-from" is now
available.  This option lets you specify a list of files to transfer, and can
be much more efficient than a recursive descent using include/exclude
statements (if you know in advance what files you want to transfer).  The list
of files can come from either side of the connection, so it is possible for a
server to provide the file-list that lets someone grab a server-specified set of
files, for example.  See the <a href="https://download.samba.org/pub/rsync/rsync.html">rsync man page</a>
for more details.

<p>For a full list of changes in version 2.6.0, see the
<a href="https://download.samba.org/pub/rsync/src/rsync-2.6.0-NEWS">release NEWS</a>.
