<h1>Security As A Class Of Interface Guarantee</h1>

<time>10 August 2014 23:45 UTC</time>

<div id="toc"></div>

<p>This post is anÂ attempt to pin down my intuition that an âinterfaceâ, broadly
defined, can be a productive conceptual frame for a wide variety of security
problems and solutions. I canât promise that this post makes total sense; itâs
just thinking out loud at this point.</p>

<p>There are many ways to understand software security engineering. One
(all-too-)prevalent view is of security as a cat-and-mouse game: by hook or by
crook, any little thing you can do to attack or avoid being attacked counts as
âsecurity engineeringâ. Especially for defenders, this view leads directly to
failure. Itâs analogous to micro-optimizing a fragment of code (a) before
profiling it to see if itâs really a hot spot; (b) without testing to see if the
micro-optimizations help or hurt; and (c) without any quantified performance
target.</p>

<p>For example, consider a web application firewall (WAF). People often buy
these to âsecureâ their web applications, saying things like, âHey, even if the
web application is well-engineered, <a
href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/belt_and_suspenders">belt and suspenders,
right</a>?! Belt and suspenders!â But ask: How much does the WAF cost to buy?
How much does it cost to install, configure, and run? Who looks at its logs and
reports, and how much does that personâs time cost? (Donât forget the
opportunity cost.)</p>

<p>How does the WAF affect the applicationâs performance and reliability?
Possibly not well.</p>

<p>How much attack surface does the WAF itself create and expose? Often, a WAF
can create significant new risk. I once found an XSS vulnerability in a web
application, and ran a demonstration exploit so I could document that it worked.
No big surprise there. After a while, a guy came up to me and said he was he WAF
operator for that app, and did these weird pop-ups he kept seeing have anything
to do with my security testing? I didnât even know the app was (supposedly)
being protected by a WAF, but I had accidentally exploited both the app and the
WAF in one shot.</p>

<p>AÂ correct WAF configuration is equivalent to fixing the bug in the original
application. Why not just do that?</p>

<p>I want to forget all about both belts and suspenders; instead, I want to buy
pants that actually fit.</p>

<aside>A note on terminology: In this blog post, Iâll use the
termÂ <strong>interface</strong> to mean any of:Â user interface, programming
language syntax and semantics, in-process API, system call, RPC and network
protocol, orÂ <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2007/399.pdf">ceremony</a>. Iâll
useÂ <strong>guarantee</strong> to include design contracts with explicit
non-guarantees. Iâll useÂ <strong>caller</strong> to mean any of: human
programmer, human user, call-site in source code, or requesting network protocol
peer. AÂ <strong>callee</strong> is a person who receives a message (e.g. an
individual or the operator of a remoteÂ service), an API or library
implementation or other in-process called function, or an RPC or network
protocol respondent. AnÂ <strong>interface definition</strong> is any
programmatic function signature (including identifiers and type annotations),
type semantics, visual <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiotic_engineering">semiotics</a>Â of a GUI
or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface">CLI</a>, et c.
that attempts to communicate the meaning and guarantees of the interface to
callers. TheÂ <strong>primary interface definition</strong> is the immediately
accessibleÂ surface of the interface itself, e.g. a function or method
declaration, an IDL specification or other code generation/specification system
for network protocols, the grammar of a programming language, or aÂ user-facing
GUI or CLI. A <strong>secondary interface definition</strong> is supplementary
material; usually documentation, annotation, post-facto errata, entries in
issueÂ trackers, commit log messages, et c.</aside>

<h2>Security Is Part Of Every Interface</h2>

<p>I prefer to think of security as a class of interface guarantee. In
particular, security guarantees are a kind of correctness guarantee. At every
interface of every kindâââuser interface, programming language syntax and
semantics, in-process APIs, kernel APIs, RPC and network protocols, ceremoniesâââ<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_by_contract">explicit and implicit
design guarantees</a> (promises, contracts) are in place, and determine the
degree of âsecurityâ (however defined) the system can possibly achieve.</p>

<p>Design guarantees might or might not actually hold in the implementationâââsoftware tends to haveÂ bugs, after all. Callers and callees can sometimes (but
not always) defend themselves against untrustworthy callees and callers
(respectively) in various ways that depend on the circumstances and on the
nature of caller and callee. In this sense an interface is an <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_surface">attack surface</a>âââbut
properly constructed, it can also be aÂ <strong>defense surface</strong>.</p>

<p>Here are some example security guarantees in hypothetical and real
interfaces:</p>

<ul>

<li><p>The functionÂ <code>bool isValidEmailAddress(String address, Set
knownTLDs)</code> returns true if the email address is syntactically valid for
SMTP addresses according to RFC 3696,Â and if the domain part is in a known
top-level domain.</p></li>

<li><p>All array accesses are checked at run time; an attempt to use an index
that is less than zero or greater than or equal to the length of the array
causes anÂ <code>ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException</code> to be thrown. (From the <a
href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se8/html/jls-10.html#jls-10.4">Java
Language Specification</a>.)</p></li>

<li><p>DNS queries and responses can be read, copied, deleted, altered, and
forged by an attacker on any network segment between client and server.</p></li>

<li><p>Within a single goroutine, the happens-before order is the order
expressed by the program. (From the <a href="http://golang.org/ref/mem">Go
language documentation</a>.)</p></li>

</ul>

<h2>The Interface Perception Gap</h2>

<p>The true technical security guarantee that an interfaceâs implementation
provides is not necessarily the same as the guarantee the caller perceives. Iâll
call this the <strong>interface perception gap</strong>, for lack of a
less-awful term. The gap could existÂ for many reasons, including at least:</p>

<ul>

<li><p>the guarantee is implicit (i.e. not inÂ the interface definition)</p></li>

<li><p>the guarantee is explicit, but the caller did not read or understand the
interface definition</p>

<ul>

<li><p>possibly because the interface definition is too complex for the caller
to understand</p></li>

<li><p>possibly because the guarantee is not in the callerâs mental model of the
interface or of the callerâs own requirements</p></li>

</ul>
</li>

<li><p>the interface misuses terms in its own definition</p></li>

<li><p>the interface definition is so poor that the caller must imagine their
own implicit definition</p></li>

</ul>

<p>Gaps in contracts tend, over time, to become implicit guarantees and
non-guarantees. It can be possible to assertÂ new technical guarantees in the
gaps. Consider <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_space_layout_randomization">address
space layout randomization</a> (ASLR). The executable loaders of operating
systems never specified the precise location in memory of the program text,
heap, stack, libraries, et c. in memory; this freed up implementors to randomize
those locations to thwart exploit developers, cat-and-mouse style. When it was
invented, ASLR was a decent way to buy some time (a couple years at most) for
the authors of programs written in unsafe languages to fix their bugs or port to
safe languages. However, it was never going to be possible for ASLR to fully
solve the problems of unsafe languages, for many reasons, including at
least:</p>

<ul>

<li><p>ASLR was a new technical guarantee retrofitted into the interface
perception gap of pre-existing executable loaders that had to be <em>compatible
with existing code</em>, and thus not all program components could be randomized
with a high degree of entropy.</p>

<ul>

<li>And ASLR is an all-or-nothing affair: If the attacker can reliably locate
<em>any</em> executable code, they can almost certainly find gadgets useful for
exploitation there.</li>

</ul>
</li>

<li><p>Programs generally must be recompiled with new options, or at least with
old options previouslyÂ thought of as being exclusively for dynamically-loadable
libraryÂ codeâââthat is, there wasnât <em>enough</em> of a perception gap in the
toolchainsâ interfaces! As a result, the guarantee of ASLR is stillÂ not
ubiquitous, more than a decade later.</p></li>

<li><p>Many program errors are still exploitable due to the limited granularity
of what program parts can be efficiently randomizedâââthere is an implicit
guarantee of run-time efficiency that extreme ASLR couldÂ violate.</p>

<ul>

<li>Sometimes even coarse-grained ASLR violates certain extreme performance
requirements.</li>

</ul>
</li>

<li><p>In applications that give attackers significant but not
directlyÂ malicious control over run-time behaviorâââfor example, as any dynamic
programming environment like a web browserÂ <em>must</em> doâââthe <a
href="https://www.blackhat.com/presentations/bh-europe-07/Sotirov/Presentation/bh-eu-07-sotirov-apr19.pdf">attacker
can significantly reduce the effective entropy of ASLR</a>, thus weakening the
already-weak guarantee.</p></li>

<li><p>Previously low-severity bugs, like single-word out-of-bounds read errors,
become information leaks that can undo all the benefits of ASLR and enable an
attacker to craft a reliable exploit. The implied âinterfaceâ of an
out-of-bounds read primitive changes: while an OOB read should be guaranteed not
to happen, the âguaranteeâ changesÂ from âlikely possible but mostly harmlessâ to
âthere goes ASLR... now all those ROP exploits are back in scope.â
Oops.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>Perhaps because ASLR was not (to my knowledge) clearly documented as a
temporary cat-and-mouse game, engineers have come to rely on it as being the
thing that makes the continued use of unsafe languages acceptable. Unsafe (and
untyped) languages will always be guaranteed to be unsafe, and we should have
used the time ASLR bought us to aggressively replace our software with
equivalents implemented in safe languages.Â Instead, we linger in a zone of
ambiguity, taking the (slight) performance hit of ASLR yet not effectively
gaining much safety from it.</p>

<p>Sometimes, interface perception gaps are surfaced, and the interface and
implementation change to close the gap. A classic example is the <a
href="http://bugs.python.org/issue13703">denial-of-service problem in hash
tables</a>: If an attacker can influence or completely control the keys of the
pairs inserted into a hash table, they can cause the performance to degrade from
the (widely perceivedâââbut usually explicitly disclaimed!) ~ <em>O</em>(1)
performance guarantee for hash table lookup. Defenders can either explicitly
claim the performance guarantee by randomizing the hash functionÂ in a way the
attacker cannot predict, or (if they specified a more abstract interface) switch
to an implementation (such as a red-black tree) that does not suffer from the
problem.</p>

<h2>The Importance Of Explicit Guarantees</h2>

<p>The technical strength of a security mechanism is limited when it is not
backed by an explicit contract.Â Explicit, understandable, tested, and enforced
guarantees, which could reasonably fit into the callerâs mental model, are
best.</p>

<p>A guarantee that is not also perceived by its callers is limited in
effectiveness. Consider an interface for a map data structure: If the
implementation is guaranteed to be a sorted tree, callers can trust that they
can iterate over the keys in sorted order without having to do any extra work.
But if they donât understand that part of the interface definition, they might
mistakenly waste time and space by extracting all the keys into an array and
pointlessly re-sorting it. The problem is reversed if the interface is
explicitly defined to be (say) a hash table, but the caller does not realize
that.</p>

<p>Similarly, a security guarantee that callers do not perceiveâââbut which is
presentâââcan cause callers to miscalculate their risk as being higher than it
is. While it might seem that is OK, because callers will âerr on the side of
cautionâ, in fact the misperception can have an opportunity cost. (In a sense, a
self-denial-of-service.)</p>

<p>A non-guarantee that is not perceived can also become dangerous. For example,
<a
href="http://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security/security-faq#TOC-Why-aren-t-physically-local-attacks-in-Chrome-s-threat-model-">although
documentation explicitly disclaims it</a>, users often perceive that programs
can maintain (e.g.) confidentiality for the userâs data even when the underlying
platform is underÂ the physical control of an attacker. Such anÂ attackerâs
capabilities tend to beÂ well outside the usersâ mental models; and in any case,
documentation (a secondary interface definition) is a poor substitute for a
user-visible interface definition in the GUI (a primary definition).</p>

<p>Interface misperceptions are sometimesÂ widely orÂ strongly held, and can
become implicit or even explicit guarantees, and can force brittleness or even
breakage into the interface. AsÂ an extreme example, consider the User Account
Control feature introduced in Windows Vista. After it was released, Microsoft
publishedÂ a blog post (a secondary interface definition) andÂ <a
href="http://blogs.technet.com/b/markrussinovich/archive/2007/02/12/638372.aspx">tried
to roll back the expectations</a> that callers developed when reading the
primary definitions (the GUI and <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Account_Control#Requesting_elevation">aspects
of the API</a>):</p>

<blockquote>It should be clear then, that neither UAC elevations nor Protected
Mode IE define new Windows security boundaries. Microsoft has been communicating
this but I want to make sure that the point is clearly heard. Further, as Jim
Allchin pointed out in his blog post Security Features vs Convenience, Vista
makes tradeoffs between security and convenience, and both UAC and Protected
Mode IE have design choices that required paths to be opened in the IL wall for
application compatibility and ease of use.</blockquote>

<p>Perhaps the core problem with UAC, Integrity Levels, and User Interface
Privilege Isolation is that one interface, the security principal (in Windows,
represented by the <a
href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/Aa374909.aspx">access token</a>),
is too hard to composeÂ with another interface: the traditional
multi-process/single principal windowing environment for presenting user
interfaces.Â Modern platforms require aÂ <a
href="http://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security/prefer-secure-origins-for-powerful-new-features">2-part
security principal</a>Â (see the Background section in that document), composable
with a user interface paradigm thatÂ allows users to distinguish the many
cooperating principals. (Consider the <a
href="https://www.usenix.org/legacy/event/sec04/tech/full_papers/shapiro/shapiro.pdf">EROS
Trusted Windowing System</a>Â as an example alternative.)</p>

<h2>Donât Imagine Interfaces Or Guarantees</h2>

<p>At the beginning of this blog post, I poked a little fun at WAFs. Making fun
of WAFsÂ is traditional picnicÂ banterÂ in my tribeÂ (application security
engineers), so I feel itÂ is only fair to put a littleÂ sacred cow hamburger on
the grill, too. Here are 2 examples.</p>

<p><a
href="http://rdist.root.org/2010/01/07/timing-independent-array-comparison/">Constant-time
array comparison</a> to defeat <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timing_attack">timing side-channel
attacks</a>. Consider for example the HMAC defense against CSRF: <code>token =
HMAC_SHA256(secret_key, session_token + action_name)</code>. It should be
computationally infeasible for the attacker to ever guess or learn the token
value, but a timing side-channel, such as that introduced by a naÃ¯ve byte array
comparison allows the attacker to guess the token in a feasible amount of time
and attempts (proportional to N = number of bits in token). A canonical solution
is to use an array comparison function that always takes the same amount of
time, rather than returning as soon as it finds a mismatch.</p>

<p>The trouble with this is that, apart from the code being slightly subtle,
there is no interface guaranteeing that the code will indeed take the same
amount of time on all inputs. Several things are permissible, given the
documented interfaces between the programmer and the ultimate execution
context:</p>

<ul>

<li><p>the compiler might find a way to optimize the function;</p></li>

<li><p>the CPUâs <code>XOR</code> instruction might not take the same amount of
time to compute all inputs; or</p></li>

<li><p>the machine (real, or virtual!) might even transform and optimize the
code before running it.</p>

<ul>

<li>For example, some processor cores accept code from one instruction set as
input, but transform it to another instruction set before running it in the
processor core.</li>

</ul>
</li>

</ul>

<p>Does the expected timing guarantee still hold, given these interfaces and
their non-guarantee? As Lawson says, the solution is fragile and you have to
test it every time the execution environment changes.</p>

<p>An additional, essentially fatal problem is that many real-world applications
are implemented in very high-level languages like Python and Java, where there
are even more layers of abstraction and therefore even less of a constant-time
interface guarantee.</p>

<p>An alternative solution, which I learned from Brad Hill, is to forget about
trying to run in constant time, and instead to <a
href="https://www.isecpartners.com/blog/2011/february/double-hmac-verification.aspx">blind
the attacker by making what timing information they learn useless</a>. Rather
than directly comparing the timing-sensitive tokens (say, SAML blob signatures
or CSRF tokens), HMAC the received blob and the expected blob again (with a new,
separate HMAC key), and then compare those HMAC outputs (with any comparison
function you want, evenÂ <code>memcmp</code>). The attacker may indeed observe a
timing side-channelâââbut the timing information will be random relative to the
input. This is due to the straightforward, documented, and tested interface
guarantee of the HMAC function as a pseudo-random function. And it works as
expected in <em>any</em> language, on any computing substrate.</p>

<p>Consider another cryptography-related security conundrum: the supposed need
to clear secrets from RAM when the secrets are no longer needed, or even to
encrypt the RAM (presumably decrypting it in registers?). This is supposedÂ to
ensure that live process RAM never hits the disk (as in e.g. swap space), nor is
available to an attacker who can read the contents of RAM. The usual threat
scenario invoked to warrant this type of defense is that of a physically-local
forensic attacker, usually of relatively high capability (e.g. capable of
performing a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_boot_attack">cold boot
attack</a> or a live memory dump). The goal is to not reveal secrets (e.g. Top
Secret documents, passwords, encryption keys, et c.) to such an attacker.</p>

<p>The trouble with this goal is that there can beÂ no interface guarantee that
clearing memory in one area will fully erase all copies of the data. The virtual
memory managers of modern operating systems, and the dynamic heap allocators of
modern language run-times, in fact guarantee very little in the way of memory
layout or deterministic behavior. Instead they provide guarantees of
more-or-less high performance, which additional security guarantees could
complicate or render infeasible.</p>

<ul>

<li><p>If you <a
href="http://linux.die.net/man/3/realloc"><code>realloc</code></a> memory, the
userland run-time or the kernel might make a copy that you can no longer
reliably reference (so you canât reliably clear it).</p></li>

<li><p>When you free memory, the kernel might not zero the pages out until the
last second before giving them to the next requestor. Thus, the time window in
which they are prone to discovery by the forensic attacker increases.</p></li>

<li><p>Kernel APIs like <a
href="https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man2/mlock.2.html"><code>mlock</code></a>,
which purport to lock memory into physical RAM pages (stopping the pages from
being swapped out to disk), doÂ not necessarily work the way you expect, or even
at all.</p></li>

<li><p>In a garbage-collected run-time, essentially any amount of copying,
moving, and reallocating is possible. There can be no guarantee that a piece of
data is stored in exactly 1 location in RAM, and that you can clear it.</p></li>

<li><p>The same holds for virtual machines, of course.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>Essentially, there can be no guarantee that a high-capability forensic
attacker cannot find secrets in RAM or swapped-out process memory; the more
complex the operating system and run-time, the less likely it is that you can
even probabilistically defeat such an attacker.</p>

<p>The most you can realistically do in the general case is mitigate the
problems with full disk encryption and whatever degree of physical security you
can get. In specific cases, such as cryptographic keys, you can keep the keys in
a tamper-resistant, tamper-evident <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_security_module">hardware security
module</a>.</p>

<h2>âConclusionâ</h2>

<p>This post is partly an attempt to investigateÂ why the âsecurity vs.
convenienceâ dichotomyÂ is false. I think itâs worse than a false dichotomy,
really; itâs a fundamental misconception of what security is and of what an
interface isâââand of what âconvenienceâ (an impoverishedÂ view of usability)
is.</p>

<p>But also itâs an attempt to re-frame security engineering in a wayÂ that
allows usÂ toÂ imagine more and better solutions to security problems. For
example, when you frame your interface as an attack surface, you find yourself
ever-so-slightly in a panic mode, and focus on how to make the surface as small
as possible. Inevitably, this tends to lead to cat-and-mouseism and poor
usability, seeming to reinforce the false dichotomy. If the panic is acute, it
can even lead to nonsensical and undefendable interfaces, and a proliferation of
false boundaries (as we saw with Windows UAC).</p>

<p>If instead we frame an interface as a defense surface, we are in a mindset
that allows us to treat the interface as a shield: built for defense,
<em>testable</em>, <em>tested</em>, covering the body; but also light-weight
enough to carry and use effectively. It might seem like a semantic game; but in
my experience, thinking of a boundary as a place to buildÂ a point of strength
rather than thinking of it as something that must inevitably fall to attack
leads to solutions that in fact withstand attack better while also functioning
better for friendlyÂ callers.</p>

<p>The safest interface is still no interfaceâââdonât multiply interfaces
unnecessarily. But when you must expose something, expose a well-tested shield
rather than merely trying to narrow your profile or hide behind a tree.</p>
