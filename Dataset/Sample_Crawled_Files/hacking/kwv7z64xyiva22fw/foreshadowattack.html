    Foreshadow is a speculative execution attack on Intel processors
    which allows an attacker to steal sensitive information stored inside personal computers or third party
    clouds. Foreshadow has two versions, the original attack designed to extract data from <abbr title="Software Guard eXtensions">SGX</abbr> enclaves and a Next-Generation version which affects 
	Virtual Machines (VMs), hypervisors (VMM), operating system (OS) kernel memory, and System Management Mode (SMM) memory.

			At a high level, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_Guard_Extensions">SGX</a>
			is a new  feature in modern Intel CPUs which
			allows computers to protect usersâ data even if the entire system falls under
			the attackerâs control. While it was previously believed that SGX is resilient
			to speculative execution attacks (such as <a href="https://meltdownattack.com/">Meltdown</a> and <a href="https://spectreattack.com/">Spectre</a>), Foreshadow
			demonstrates how speculative execution can be exploited for reading the
			contents of SGX-protected memory as well as extracting the machineâs private attestation key.
			Making things worse, due to SGXâs privacy features, an attestation report cannot be linked to the identity of its signer.
			Thus, it only takes a single compromised SGX machine to erode trust in the
			entire SGX ecosystem.

        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        The KU Leuven authors discovered the vulnerability, independently
        developed the attack, and first notified Intel on January 3, 2018.
        Their work was done independently from and concurrently to other recent
        x86 speculative execution vulnerabilities, notably Meltdown and
        Spectre.
    </p>
    <p>
        The authors from Technion, University of Michigan, the
        University of Adelaide and CSIRO's Data61 independently discovered and reported the
        vulnerability and associated attack to Intel during the embargo period on
        January 23, 2018.
    <p> 
    Following our discovery of Foreshadow (CVE-2018-3615), Intel identified two closely related variants, <!-- which we call Foreshadow-NG (Next Generation, CVE-2018-3620 and CVE-2018-3646),  -->potentially affecting additional microprocessors, SMM code, Operating system and Hypervisor software.  We collectively refer to these Intel-discovered variants as Foreshadow-NG (Next Generation, CVE-2018-3620 and CVE-2018-3646), whereas Intel refers to this entire class of speculative execution side channel vulnerabilities  as âL1 Terminal Fault" (L1TF). More information on L1TF can be found <a href="https://software.intel.com/security-software-guidance/software-guidance/l1-terminal-fault">here</a>.

	What technologies are affected by Foreshadow-NG?
	</p>
	<p class = "answer">
    <i class="fa fa-chevron-right answer-chevron" aria-hidden="true"></i>
  
  Foreshadow-NG can be used for extracting <b> any </b> information
  residing in the L1 cache, including information belonging to the <a

    <ul>
		<li>A user processes can potentially read kernel memory belonging to the OS.</li>
		<li>A malicious guest VM (running on the cloud) can potentially read memory belonging to the VM's hypervisor or memory belonging to another guest VM running on the cloud.</li>
		<li>A malicious OS to read memory protected by the SMM.</li>

The Foreshadow / L1-terminal-fault attack were assigned the following CVE numbers: 
    <ul>
	<li> CVE-2018-3615 for attacking SGX. </li>
	<li> CVE-2018-3620 for attacking the OS Kernel and SMM mode.</li>
	<li> CVE-2018-3646 for attacking virtual machines. </li>
    </ul>

	<p class = "question">
	What is a virtual machine?
	</p>
	<p class = "answer">
    <i class="fa fa-chevron-right answer-chevron" aria-hidden="true"></i>
    A
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine"> Virtual Machine</a> is a software emulator of a physical computer. Virtual machines are often used in compute clouds (such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Web_Services">Amazon's AWS</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Azure">Microsoft's Azure</a>) where, instead of maintaining their own infrastructure, customers can pay for the time the cloud infrastructure spends on running the customer's machine (and the computations within it). As clouds typically run more than one virtual machine on the same physical hardware, it is important that the cloud's Virtual Machine Manager (VMM) or hypervisor prevents information leakage across VM boundaries by ensuring complete isolation between two virtual machines and between the virtual machines and the hypervisor.
	</p>
	
	<p class = "question">
	So how does Foreshadow-NG affect VMs?
	</p>
	<p class = "answer">
    <i class="fa fa-chevron-right answer-chevron" aria-hidden="true"></i>
    Foreshadow-NG breaks the above mentioned isolation. Thus, a malicious virtual machine running inside the cloud can potentially read data belonging to other virtual machines as well as data belonging to the cloud's hypervisor. 
	</p>
	</p>
	
		<p class = "question">
	What is an operating system kernel?
	</p>
	<p class = "answer">
    <i class="fa fa-chevron-right answer-chevron" aria-hidden="true"></i>
    The <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(operating_system)">operating
      system kernel</a> is the core of the operating system, and is
    responsible for managing most of the operations that a computer performs.
    In particular, the kernel manages the computer's memory and CPU time as
    well as ensures isolation between two programs running on the same
    computer. Given its important role, the kernel has access to all the data
    stored in the computer's memory, including data belonging to other
    programs.
	</p>
	
	<p class = "question">
	So how does Foreshadow-NG affect the kernel?
	</p>
	<p class = "answer">
    <i class="fa fa-chevron-right answer-chevron" aria-hidden="true"></i>
	Using Foreshadow-NG, a malicious program running on the computer might be able to read some parts of the kernel's data. As the kernel has access to data stored by other programs, a malicious program might be able
	to exploit Foreshadow-NG to access data belonging to other programs. 
	</p>
	
    <p class = "question">
	What is Intel SGX?
	</p>
	<p class = "answer">
    <i class="fa fa-chevron-right answer-chevron" aria-hidden="true"></i>
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_Guard_Extensions">Intel Software Guard eXtensions (SGX)</a>
    is a Trusted Execution Environment
    (TEE) that enables secure program execution in untrusted environments. The program
    and the data it operates on, are placed inside a secure enclave. There they are protected from modification or inspection, even
    in the presence of a highly-privileged adversary corrupting the operating system, hypervisor, or firmware (BIOS). SGX also provides a remote attestation protocol that allows software to prove to a remote party that it is running on a genuine SGX-enabled Intel processor, as opposed to a (potentially malicious) simulator.
	</p>

    <p class = "question">
	Was the confidentiality of SGX enclaves affected by Foreshadow?
	</p>
	<p class = "answer">
    <i class="fa fa-chevron-right answer-chevron" aria-hidden="true"></i>
    Yes. Foreshadow enables an attacker to read the entire SGX enclave's memory contents.
    This includes architectural enclaves provided
    by Intel such as the Quoting and Launch Enclaves. 
	</p>
	
	<p class = "question">
	Was the remote attestation protocol affected by Foreshadow?
	</p>
	<p class = "answer">
    <i class="fa fa-chevron-right answer-chevron" aria-hidden="true"></i>
    Yes. Using Foreshadow we have successfully extracted the attestation keys, used by the Intel
    Quoting Enclave to vouch for the authenticity of enclaves. As a result, we 
    were able to generate "valid" attestation quotes. Using these counterfeit quotes, 
    successfully "proved" to a remote party that a "genuine" enclave was running while, in fact, 
    the code was running outside of SGX, under our complete control. </p>
	
	<p class = "question">
	Is SGX long-term storage affected by Foreshadow?
	</p>
	<p class = "answer">
    <i class="fa fa-chevron-right answer-chevron" aria-hidden="true"></i>
    Yes. As Foreshadow enables an attacker to extract SGX sealing keys, previously sealed data can be modified and re-sealed. With the extracted sealing key, an attacker can trivially calculate a valid Message Authentication Code (MAC), thus depriving the data owner from the ability to detect the modification. 
	</p>

	<p class = "question">
    Can I detect if someone has exploited Foreshadow to read my data?
    </p>
	<p class = "answer">
    <i class="fa fa-chevron-right answer-chevron" aria-hidden="true"></i>
    Not likely. Foreshadow does not leave traces in typical log files.
    While installing a new (malicious) driver may leave traces in the system log,
    the attacker can probably alter the log buffer, since she has root privileges. 
<br/>
    A kernel-level attacker using a Foreshadow attack may apply tricks to significantly increase her chances of success.
    While installing a new (malicious) driver may leave traces in the system log,
    such a privileged attacker can probably alter the log afterwards.
    </p>


    <p class = "question">
    What about other processors (AMD/ARM)?
	</p>
	<p class = "answer">
    <i class="fa fa-chevron-right answer-chevron" aria-hidden="true"></i>
	The original Foreshadow attack affects most SGX-enabled Intel processors. As SGX is currently
    present only in Intel CPUs, we are unaware of Foreshadow affecting other CPU
    vendors. To the best of our understanding, Foreshadow-NG only affects Intel processors. However, we are still working to better understand the implications of Foreshadow-NG and this answer might change as the situation develops. 
    </ul>

    <p class = "question">
    Did you release the source code of your exploits?
	</p>
	<p class = "answer">
    <i class="fa fa-chevron-right answer-chevron" aria-hidden="true"></i>
    For educational purposes, we integrated basic support for Foreshadow-type
    transient execution attacks into the open-source SGX-Step enclave

	<p class = "question">
	Are there mitigations against Foreshadow?
	</p>
	<p class = "answer">
    <i class="fa fa-chevron-right answer-chevron" aria-hidden="true"></i>
    Foreshadow and Foreshadow-NG require mitigations at the both software and microcode level. This includes updates to most operating systems, hypervisors as well as CPU microcode updates. See 
	<a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/security-center/advisory/intel-sa-00161.html">Intel's security advisory</a> and our <a href="foreshadow-NG.pdf">technical report</a> for additional details.
	</p>

	<p class = "question">
	Have you evaluated any software or microcode updates?
	</p>
	<p class = "answer">
    <i class="fa fa-chevron-right answer-chevron" aria-hidden="true"></i>
	We are currently still evaluating microcode and software patches but have not discovered any vulnerabilities. For technical experts, our technical report discusses our view on these mitigations in more detail.
	</p>
	
	<p class = "question">
	Do Spectre and Meltdown mitigations such as Retpoline,
        <abbr title="Kernel Page Table Isolation">KPTI</abbr>,
        <abbr title="Indirect Branch Restricted Speculation">IBRS</abbr>,
        <abbr title="Single Thread Indirect Branch Predictors">STIBP</abbr>, or

        mitigate Foreshadow?
	</p>
	<p class = "answer">
    <i class="fa fa-chevron-right answer-chevron" aria-hidden="true"></i>
    No. The mitigations against Meltdown and Spectre are not effective against Foreshadow and Foreshadow-NG.
	</p>
	
    
	<p class = "question">
	How is Foreshadow different from Meltdown?
	</p>
	<p class = "answer">
    <i class="fa fa-chevron-right answer-chevron" aria-hidden="true"></i>
	Foreshadow is different from Meltdown as it targets virtual machines and SGX in addition to data stored in the operating system's kernel (which was targeted by Meltdown). While harder to exploit, Foreshadow is effective against systems deploying Kernel Page Table Isolation (KPTI), which stops Meltdown attacks. 
	</p>
	
	<p class = "question">
	How is Foreshadow different from prior Spectre-like attacks on SGX? 
	</p>
	<p class = "answer">
    <i class="fa fa-chevron-right answer-chevron" aria-hidden="true"></i>
	Concurrent speculative execution attacks on SGX, e.g., <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.09085">SGXPectre</a>,
    rely on the code of the affected enclave to contain gadgets vulnerable to
    Spectre. Thus, such attacks can be theoretically mitigated 
    by removing these gadgets from the affected enclave. In contrast, Foreshadow
    extracts enclave memory without relying on <em>any</em> code vulnerability in
    the victim enclave or even without requiring the affected enclave to execute.
    As such, Foreshadow can be used even in the case where the code of the affected
    enclave is "perfect", i.e., does not contain any side-channel vulnerability.

	What CPUs are affected by Foreshadow and Foreshadow-NG?

    Intel confirmed that Foreshadow affects all SGX-enabled Core processors
    (Skylake and Kaby Lake), while Atom family processors with SGX support

	<p class = "question">
	Why is it called Foreshadow?
	</p>
	<p class = "answer">
    <i class="fa fa-chevron-right answer-chevron" aria-hidden="true"></i>

    In literature, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreshadowing">"foreshadowing"</a>
    is used to indicate a trick where a writer provides a subtle hint of
    what is to come later in the story. Analogous to how a good story teller
    tries to keep the outcome of the story (mostly) secret, the speculative
    execution mechanisms found in modern processors, do not <em>directly</em>
    leak secrets. In the storytelling analogy,
    the Foreshadow attack shows, however, that
    clever adversaries can abuse subtle hints in the present to reconstruct
    secrets from future instructions.
